# Wrangle-and-Analyze-Data-WeRateDogs-Achieve
WeRateDogs is a twitter account that rates dog pictures. This project provides insight of WeRateDogs archive data from gathering to wrangling, to analysing and visualising. 

Two dataset with incomplete information were provided. To gather other useful data, I queried the Twitter API for each tweet's JSON data using Python's Tweepy library and store them in tweet_json.txt file.
