# Wrangle-and-Analyze-Data-WeRateDogs-Achieve
WeRateDogs is a twitter account that rates dog pictures. This project provides insight of WeRateDogs archive data from gathering to wrangling, to analysing and visualising, which is included in `wrangle_act.ipynb` or `wrangle_act.html`.

Two dataset with incomplete information were provided, namely `twitter_archive_enhanced.csv` and `image_predictions.tsv` . To gather other useful data, I queried the Twitter API for each tweet's JSON data using Python's Tweepy library and store them in `tweet_json.txt` file.

- Cleaned dataset is stored in `twitter_archive_master.csv`.
- `wrangle_report.pdf` briefly describes the wrangling efforts.
- `act_report.pdf`communicates the insights and displays the visualization produced from the wrangled data.
